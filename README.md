## OVERVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS: 
• The recommendation system aims to suggest the most relevant restaurants to users 
based on their preferences for cuisine type. It provides personalized restaurant 
recommendations to help users discover new places to eat based on their unique 
preferences. 

## HOW IT WORKS: 
• The system takes into various attributes such as rating, pricing and geographic location 
of restaurants to generate recommendations. 
• Content-Based Filtering is used to match user preferences with restaurant features (e.g., 
price, rating, city or restaurant name). 

## WHAT USERS CAN EXPECT: 
• Users will receive destination and hotel recommendations that best match their 
preferences. 
• The recommended destination and hotel come with key details like rating, location, 
description facilities and price to make it easier for users to decide where to travel. 
• The system ensures variety in the recommendations.
